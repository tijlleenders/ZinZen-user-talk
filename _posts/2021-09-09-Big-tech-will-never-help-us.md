*Big tech is still not suggesting Todo's...*  
Why not?  
Because free e-mail, free media, free phone systems, and free browsers are more profitable.  
Big tech sells ads by auction. Think about it for a second. Your valuable time ... is sold to the highest bidder.  
Suggesting Todo's would lead them down a path to create the *best ads* for you. Tsss... Very bad for business.  
Advertisers would even refuse to pay. The best ad will be shown to you anyway!  
  
...crickets...  
  
*ZinZen provides an alternative:* social privacy-friendly Todo suggestions - by a company that chooses people over profits, enforced by law.  
1. Make your goals and priorities explicit.  
2. Share them with ZinZen and others. Transparency about shared goals is where trust and cooperation begins.  
3. Watch how your calendar automagically fills up with prioritized, realistic and attainable next best actions.  
4. Enjoy the moment. Focus. Play. Your calendar knows the way.  
5. Share what worked for you. Help others choose their path.  
  
Hopefully, this will get us to open standards for decentrally defining, sharing and discovering better ways to realize our goals.  
As individuals - and as a species!
