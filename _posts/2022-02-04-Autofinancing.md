## I'm now committing money and ideas - not code
Let's face the facts: What I was doing wasn't working.  

I was trying to convince investors to invest in a world without them... in the traditional sense. With ZinZen, control and risk-taking are decoupled. Investors are distributed. They don't make decisions. Investors make a small or big gamble - and get a small or big capped return. This never leads to a centralized seat on the board. There is no board.  

Meanwhile I was trying to code up a working version of the app without the skills necessary to do so. Blood, sweat and tears are not moving the needle.  

The solution:  
We can get a lot more done with me working as a freelance architect. I use the income from that job to finance real developers in countries where wages are comparatively lower.
