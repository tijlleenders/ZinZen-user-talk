Finding investors for a non-extractive paradigm is hard.  
So I'll finance ZinZen® myself. [Read more...](https://blog.zinzen.me/2022/02/04/Autofinancing.html)   

 

## I'm now committing money and ideas - not code
Let's face the facts: What I was doing wasn't working.  

I was trying to convince investors to invest in a world without them... in the traditional sense. With ZinZen®, control and risk-taking are decoupled. Investors are distributed. They don't make decisions. Investors make a small or big gamble - and get a small or big capped return. This never leads to a centralized seat on the board. There is no board.  

Meanwhile I was trying to code up a working version of the app without the skills necessary to do so. Blood, sweat and tears are not moving the needle.  

The solution:  
We can get a lot more done with everyone working their strengths: me as a freelance architect and Mallika and Wilfried as professional developers.   
  
## A warm welcome and good luck to Mallika and Wilfried!
