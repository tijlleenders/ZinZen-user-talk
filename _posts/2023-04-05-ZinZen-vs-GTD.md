# GTD® just doesn't cut it  

Let me start by saying [Getting Things Done® by David Allan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) helped a lot of people.  It has valuable concepts like:  
- time blocking  
- next actions  
- a trusted system  

That said, it just didn't work for me because:  
- It's not simple  
- It's not easy to remember  
- It's hard to keep it up
  - you need 📐discipline📐 for the weekly review  
  - building the reflexes takes ⏳time⏳  

I suppose I'm not the only one?  
Do [let me know](https://zinzen.me/Home/ZinZen/Feedback) if you disagree!


# Is ✨ZinZen®✨ better?  

## Yes, it's simpler!  
### 1. One-time setup
- You make a time budget per area of your life: work, family, hobbies, etc
  - How many hours per week?
  - Any particular preference for
    - days of the week?
    - times of the day?
    - number of time blocks? 
- You organize your goals in a hierarchy
  - Start with your big, important life goals
  - Keep adding subgoals until you're satisfied.  
  You don't _have_ to add detail if that's not your thing.

### 2. After that... when life happens:   

- Change your goals  
- Change estimated durations  
- Optionally add an order  


**That's it!**  
🤯🤯🤯  
Really... _that's it_.  

Here's a picture illustrating the differences:

## Show - don't tell  
Here's a little demo of a standard setup:

## Bonus: you get collaboration on goals!
ZinZen® is designed for collaboration, with a twist:
- it doesn't care about organizations  
You can work together with people from work, customers, your family, friends, all from your single tool.  
- it doesn't care about identities  
You can also share ideas anonymously with the world - and get idea's back. It doesn't matter who they are or where they are. If they have good suggestions for you ... why not?  

## What's the catch?
ZinZen® isn't finished.  
I'm pouring all of my time and savings into this project, and we have some open source developers working for free, but we need a little extra [financial help](https://donate.stripe.com/6oE4jK1iPcPT1m89AA) to go faster!  

ZinZen® is:
- open source
- not-for-profit
  - a fully usable version runs for free on your phone - but we will charge for non-essential services that cost us money, like multi-device sync, to pay back loans we took for development of the app. We don't have shareholders that eternally extract value.  
- private by design
- secure by design
