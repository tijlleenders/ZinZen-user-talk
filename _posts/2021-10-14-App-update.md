Here's what we've been up to the last two weeks.

## Visible updates
- Near-instant loading
  - You no longer wait 100ms to see the subs when you click on a list, it's single digit milliseconds!
- Edit screen
  - You can (finally) edit a title.
  - When editing a list you see the direct parents.  
Soon you'll be able to add/remove them - so you can move lists around or have multiple paths to your list.
  - Commands are suggested as you type.  
You can add/remove them by clicking the suggestion or the command.
- App reload more bearable
  - Nobody likes waiting. When loading the app, a random quote is shown instead of a moving circle.  
It doesn't change the loading time, but makes the wait less annoying / obvious.


## Invisible updates
- Faster scheduler, run locally
  - We're re-writing the scheduler in C to make it faster. You'll see it soon.
  - It will be run in your browser to make it even faster (no communication to the cloud necessary).
  - This allows us to offer ZinZen at a lower price...
  - ...and this brings ZinZen one step closer to 100% private offline use!
- Test suites
  - We're writing lots of tests (before we implement).  
This will not improve the app as of today, but will make anything we do from here more effective and efficient.
