## The idea funnel method

Over the year's I'v had many ideas for starting companies. This can be quite time-consuming. I've learned from my studies that having a framework can drastically improve both the effectiveness and the quality of your idea funnel. My method is a series of questions.  
If the answer to any question is no - the idea is disqualified. Period.

  
### Is it instantly clear what it is?  
Can you explain the following to an 8 year old?
- Product
- Offering
- Value (customer pain & gain)
- Uniqueness - why you?

If not - I have no idea what you're doing!


### Is it solving a painful problem?    
Are there people are screaming in pain - wanting a solution?


### Will people instantly buy it?    
Who has committed to buying this?
Are there early adopters?
Do they need to be educated first?
Is value hard to explain?
Is marketplace ready for this?
  
### What is the profit margin now?  
Don't count on scaling up if you're not profitable...  
And if you can't make a profit fast then forget about it.  
Can the world afford it in the early stages?
  
### Has anyone tried it yet?  
If no one has tried - you probably shouldn't either.  
Do your research to see what you're missing.  
You better have a very good reason why your attempt is worthwile.

### Can you beat the competition?  
If you go head-to-head in technical/sales battle, will you lose?
Are you hoping to be acquired? Why can't they just kill you?
  
### Customer segment specific enough?  
Don't believe everyone is a customer... it's not true.  
Usually there is only a nitch that will actually buy.
  
### Are you coachable?  
...or un-coachable (I'm doing it my way)  
...or blinded by love (don't care about other ideas)  
...or a broken bridge (you don't understand).  
   
### Have you spent time on all aspects?  
How many hours did they spend on different aspects?  
Area's that no-one is working on are very problematic...  
Maybe the wrong people are working on the project.  
Maybe you need to hire new people.  
  
### Can you protect it?  
You need patents or an 'unfair advantage'. Also it has to be enforceable or there are no barriers to entry.
  
### Is it more than a one-trick pony?  
Should be able to evolve/iterate into a whole world of possibilities.  
  
### Are you building a non-vertical company?  
You probably can't do everything yourself.  
Who is helping you with supply-chain / sales / operations etc? Play your strengths and partner smart.  
What parts of your company are commodity?   Which parts are the core differentiators that you should focus on?
  
### Are you interested in more than inventing?  
Innovating is commercializing, inventing is research and creative.  
Are you going to get stuck on gold-plating the idea and prototype - or do you have a Minimal Viable Product?  
Don't talk bigger than you are, be realistic.
  
### Have you considered the non-technical?
This is all about technology, no biz-plan, it will sell itself.  

### Can it be scaled up?
Obvious. Nothing against a lifestyle business though - but it isn't a startup ;)

### Can it be financed?
Huge amount of capital is needed.
You can't do anything with a small amount of money.
No return (NPV < 0)

### Is it more than an 'all-or-nothing' product?
No interim product or profit till you get BIG, everybody changes and you survive competition.

### Do you have the right team?  
This is critical to get right. No man is an island and no bridge get built by one person.
  
## Well, if you've made it this far...
# ...what are you waiting for?

## Wishing you all the best!
