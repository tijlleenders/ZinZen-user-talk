## PDCA is for companies - not individuals

The [Plan-Do-Check-Act/Adjust cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) assumes a pre-existing objective. It's a quality improvement management method for companies. Management will tell you what needs to be achieved - you just need to follow and improve the process and results. You can be creative in how to get there (if the company is so inclined) - but there is no room for creativeness in the goal setting itself. Management will create the objectives.  
This is ill-suited for individuals who need to set their own goals.


## Introducing DPDA
### Dream  
The 'dream' phase is about soul-searching and listening to your inner self.  
What is important in your life? Maybe a little extreme - but what would you die for if it came to it?  
Make a list of your life goals in ZinZen. Look at this list at least once a day. Ideas will come.
### Plan  
What is the smallest step towards realizing your dreams for today - or this week?  
A simple first step with any idea is to share it anonymously or with someone you trust. Let them help you to come up with concrete actions. Get 'hints' from the world around you - and take these hints seriously.  
Plan realistically. Use ZinZen to plan your day, week and month to make sure everything fits.  
Set a minimum time budget per week if you don't want your goal to be continually pushed into the future.
### Do  
When your calendar says it's time to take the first step... do it!  
You can postpone a few times if it's inconvenient - but if you really want to get closer to your dream ... you need action or you're giving up on yourself. Scheduling on the calendar is a promise to yourself.   
This can be scary. Baby steps.  
### Accept  
Don't live in your own world. When taking action, observe how the world around you reacts. Take it in without judgement. Accept that through how people and the world reacts - you are getting feedback. Your plans might be based on wrong assumptions. You might have even made the wrong assumptions about yourself too... Observe and incorporate what happens and adjust your dreams and plans accordingly. When thing go well, enjoy it. When things don't, enjoy the learnings and the knowledge that you're getting another step closer to your dreams.



## Wishing you all the best!
