I've been working like crazy since April to get something online to show potential users.
Now it's time to get interactive!

This was another crazy week. I got my first real user! ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

She immediately had several requests:
1. Clear due date button (done)
2. Filtering on done/todo (implemented sorting so done is always at bottom when refreshed - ok for now?)
3. Editing title (... didn't get there yet)
4. Complete/Tick goals from calendar view

The last one is tricky... and I'm still working on it.
Since the automagic calendar can decide to split big goals into small chunks on your calendar, the calendar view is not identical to the goal list.
To be continued...
