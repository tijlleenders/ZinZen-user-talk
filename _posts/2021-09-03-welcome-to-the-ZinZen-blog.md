Since April I've been crazy busy to get a minimal working version.  
Now it's time to get interactive!

Last weekend I got my first real user! ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰  
Needless to say I was psyched (and my wife too knowing she was not the only one any more).
  
My new user immediately made several requests:
1. Clear due date button (done)
2. Filtering on done/todo (I'm showing done at bottom when refreshed - hopefully that is ok for now?)
3. Editing title (... didn't get there yet)
4. Complete/Tick goals from calendar view

The last one is tricky... and I'm still working on it.  
Since the automagic calendar can decide to split big goals into small chunks on your calendar, the calendar view is not identical to the goal list.  
To be continued...  
  
PS: All user requests will be added as issues here: https://github.com/tijlleenders/github-pages-with-jekyll/issues?q=is%3Aissue+
