## Big visible updates üéÅüéÅüéÅ

- **‚ú®Scheduler updates‚ú®**  
Announced in last update: the auto-scheduling killer feature is revealing itself:  
  - Rewritten from scratch in a simpler way by using <Rc> for counting conflicts
  - Respect the selected days filter
  - Respect minimum and maximum daily/week Budgets
  - Include simple subGoals for a Budget and count that towards the Budget, but only if the subGoal has a duration
    It will fill up the remaining budget using the Budget name
  - Allow users to set 0 as minimum budget value
  - Scheduler can handle Goal.start < Calendar.start
  - Goals without a deadline no longer considered impossible
  - Still works if every time slot for a Goal overlaps with other Goals
  - Handles tasksCompleted today to make sure they don't "shift" when input changes

- **‚ú®Basic version of hints‚ú®**
  - Want something - but no idea on how to proceed?  
    Use the ZinZen¬Æ social search engine to get suggestions!
  - It will remember which hints you deleted, so you don't see them again.
  - If you like the hint, add them to your Goals with two clicks.

  - No need to 'loooong press' anymore to drag!

- **Visual hint goal navigation**  
  - Added a visual hint to easily find the goal you're navigating to from MyTime screen. If it's in a long list this can be hard.

- **üö§ Faster navigation üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**
  - Navigate to subGoals with one click, instead of two.
  - The Goal summary, previously shown after first click, is now shown on the second screen.

- **Strike through done goals**
  - Cross-out remains visible.  
    The Goal will only move to Trash once you navigate away.  
    This is much nicer for shopping lists. It avoids Goals jumping around in the list, and you get to enjoy the satisfaction of getting things done a bit longer :).
