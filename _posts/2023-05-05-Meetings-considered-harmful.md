## Meetings considered harmful

At work, meetings are '_more than three people coming together to discuss something_'.  
All organizations have meetings - but ZinZen¬Æ won't - and for good reason.  
Just looking at [the amount of Dilbert cartoons](https://www.gocomics.com/search/full_results?terms=meeting&category=comic&short_name=dilbert) and the [urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meeting) it seems I'm not alone...   
  
**Why?**

### Meetings don't have a purpose  
Meetings are [an assembly for a certain purpose](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meeting)...  
At work, _which purpose is that again_?  

#### 1. Present something  
**Presenting is best done in a blog, podcast or vlog.** Unlike a meeting - they are asynchronous and reusable. It takes a bit of time to get right - but at least you're not wasting _a multiple_ of that time delivering a confusing message to a big group. You can also safely collect and integrate feedback from a few people first - then progressively increase the group size.  
#### 2. Discuss something  
**Discussing is a means to an end** - not a purpose in itself. If you want clarification on something that can't be answered in _a single_ message or a 2-minute voice chat - it's better to have a discussion with _exactly_ three people. One asks the questions, the other explains, the third observes - and intervenes if the discussion repeats itself or gets side-tracked. Make sure you ask the person with the authority to explain.  
#### 3. Decide something  
**Work decisions are made by the _one_ person responsible**. Giving your opinion to that person doesn't require a meeting. A 'group decision' also does not require a meeting - only a vote per person delivered in whatever way is convenient for them.  
#### 4. Improve relationships, creativity and innovation
_Seriously?_  
Let's just forget our worker hats have fun together as people!

### Meetings are barbaric  
Ok, ok. I'm exaggerating a little. But big meetings do bring out our 'animal reflexes'.  
It's a place for communicating hierarchy - when, in my opinion, there shouldn't be any.  
Those who talk - shout. Those who don't - suffer. 

### Meetings don't get documented  
With a few exceptions, meeting minutes are a combination of:
- never read
- never accurate
- never trusted
- never adapted to the target audience
- never found  

### Meetings slow you down  
It's hard to get the all these people together at the same time - and preferably in the same place. Two weeks go by ... then someone shows up late, in the wrong place, or not at all.  

### Bottom line
If you need meetings - you're doing it wrong. 

## Wishing you all the best!
