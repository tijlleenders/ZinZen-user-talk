First, a big 🙏**THANK YOU**🙏 to everyone supplying feedback!  

## Visible updates 🎁🎁🎁
- **Basic scheduling is here!**
  - 1: You edit your goals with durations, optional specific times and 'daily' repetions:  
  <img src="/img/edit_goal_for_first_calendar.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400"/>  
  Notice, the top-menu buttons, and the badges of 'commands' that are active for your goal.  
  To change the color, just press the color badge. Simple!  
  - 2: While navigating goals, the scheduling info is in the sub-title:  
  <img src="/img/first_calendar_and_top_menu_buttons.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400"/>  
  - 3: ZinZen® takes care of your calendar:  
  <img src="/img/first_calendar_view.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400"/>  
  - 3: Complete, push or skip right from the calendar:  
  <img src="/img/edit_slot.PNG" alt="drawing" width="400"/>  
  *You manage your agenda, and let ZinZen® make the calendar!*
<br />  
- **The project is open sourced**
  - You can find the app written in javascript [here](https://github.com/tijlleenders/ZinZen)  
  - ...and the scheduling engine written in Rust [here](https://github.com/tijlleenders/ZinZen-scheduler)  
- **Delete goals**
  - When you press Delete while navigating goals 'delete mode' is activated
  - When in 'delete mode' all goals shake in fear of being deleted
  - If you touch a shaking goal, it will be ejected from the screen with a swirling animation


## Invisible updates
- Designing the digital coach for improving relationships.
- Working on the automagic calendar while learning Rust.
- Still looking for a part-time job to finance the app. Very few people want a part-time freelancer...

## Wishing you all a merry Christmas! 🎄🎅
