@Testers: üôè**THANK YOU**üôè !  
@All users: Please use [the feedback page](https://zinzen.me/Feedback).

Thanks [Tushar](https://github.com/Tushar-4781) for reviewing the increasing number of contributor PRs. Thanks also to [thinkrapido](https://github.com/thinkrapido) for coming up with a new approach to coding the scheduler in Rust. We still haven't got 'the seemingly simple algorithm' working after years of work on weekends... but the code is now a lot more readable!

Also thanks to [Vinay](https://github.com/vinaybadgujar102) who has done some impressive work these months.

## Visible updates üéÅüéÅüéÅ

- **‚ú®Share a goal with multiple people‚ú®**  
This is pretty awesome. You can share your goal trees with multiple people simultaneously. Sounds simple but it did cause some headaches... You are also automatically subscribed to any changes they make to the list.

- **Focus mode for Tasks**  
You can now block out everything by setting a pomodoro-style timer for any Task on you Calendar.

- **Auto darkmode toggle**  
Sometimes you open the app up at night and it's still in light mode... Then you can quickly turn it dark by selecting the icon that appears in the header - based on the time of day. A dark icon will appear at night when in light mode - and a light icon will appear in the daytime when in dark mode. Maybe confusing? Or convenient? Make an issue!

- **Moved edit goal action to the goal circle menu**  
 This makes for a cleaner and more consistent interface. Want to do something with a goal? Click on the circle and you'll see what you can do. To signal there's a menu we also added three little dots to replace the pencil. To top it off - we made the buttons nice and big, in a quadrant instead of a list.

- **Differentiate between budgets and goals**  
 This was a major conceptual shift. We simplified the goal edit screen dramatically. Our thinking was that you set up budgets for the different area's of you life once, and afterwards adjust them infrequently. By separating budgets out into a separate edit screen - the goal adding suddenly is a lot less complicated!

- **Default budget goals**  
 To ease the initial setting up and understanding of budgets - we set up some defaults for you!

- **Added ZinZen logo text**
This was upon request from a film maker using ZinZen in a movie. The logo text was previously quite big and only visible when there were no goals in your list. Now it always shows - but more discreet at the bottom of you goal list - and without interfering with the add button.
