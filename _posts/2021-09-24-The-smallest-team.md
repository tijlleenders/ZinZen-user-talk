The universe will thank you.

Over the next few weeks we will be building out cool stuff for for the smallest team: **a couple**.  

Bigger teams will have to wait till we get it right... As a small startup - what better place to start than a world that most of us intimately know - but that has very few real solutions?

Specifically, we'll be digging into the following (sometimes problematic) expectations about schedule and priorities for/between:  

- Shopping list
  - what to eat, recipes, ingredients, shops, brands, ...
- Packing list
  - different types of trips, destination-dependant stuff, collections of related items, ...
- Chores around the house
  - cleaning, take out trash schedule, ...
- House improvement projects
  - what to do when in what order and how much time/cost?
- Gardening schedules
  - when to sow, harvest, prune the trees, tips & tricks...
- Kids responsibilities
  - school schedules, activities, play dates, ...
