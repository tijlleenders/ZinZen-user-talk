## Newspaper

ZinZen got a quasi full-page article in a Dutch newspaper with a reach of over a million subscribers. This is huge!  
Our hard work is starting to get noticed. You can read <a href="https://www.ad.nl/tech/denk-jij-na-je-vakantie-nu-ga-ik-alles-anders-doen-maar-lukt-dat-niet-met-app-van-tijl-kan-stress-verminderen~a5653214/" target="_blank">the article online here</a>.

## Movie
A dutch film maker <a href="https://www.dannysnoekvideografie.nl/" target="_blank">Danny Snoek</a> has promised to have the lead actor in his second movie 'Onbesproken Woorden' use the ZinZen app twice for a few seconds to promote usage, free of charge. üôèThank youüôè Danny, and we wish you luck with your  <a href="https://www.voordekunst.nl/projecten/14652-een-film-over-de-passie-voor-het-leven-1!" target="_blank">crowdfunding campaign</a>!


## Radio show
Tijl was invited to talk about ZinZen on a local Radio station <a href="https://www.omroephw.nl/" target="_blank">Omroep Hoeksche Waard</a>. It was a lot of fun!  
We've also learned a lot about how to improve the pitching of the app from this experience.  
You can listen to the show till the 16th of December 2022 on <a href="https://www.omroephw.nl/spelers/radiospeler.php?programmaid=214&item=021220222000" target="_blank">this radio player</a>.  

## Wishing you all the best!
