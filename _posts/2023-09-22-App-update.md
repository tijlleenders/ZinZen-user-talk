@Testers: üôè**THANK YOU**üôè !  
@All users: Please use [the feedback page](https://zinzen.me/Feedback).

Thanks [Tushar](https://github.com/Tushar-4781) for ongoing efforts on the user experience and interface - as well as the work on the data model supporting a complex ecosystem of sharing goals. Thanks also to [Moaz](https://github.com/moaz-mokhtar) for the many updates to the scheduler.  
A big welcome to [Kobe](https://github.com/kobe-reygel). His first big contributions:
- restructured documentation
- a 20 line change that increased the speed of the automagic calender 27 times!

## Visible updates üéÅüéÅüéÅ

- **‚ú®New logo‚ú®**  
The previous logo was nice, but didn't quite fit the ZinZen¬Æ brand identity. It was also easily confused with a hamburger menu.  
The new logo is bright, fresh and sunny. The interlocking Z's stand for Zin and Zen, as well as the cooperation between people. The angles are gently rounded - just like in nature and the rest of the app.    
  <img src="/img/new_logo.png" alt="new-logo" width="400"/>  
  
- **Task actions**  
We've made it possible to 'tick off' a task in the calendar - or forget it completely. Of course we've added a nice sound effect to go with it.  
<img src="/img/complete_or_skip_task.gif" alt="task-actions" width="400"/>  

- **Public groups integrated with hints**  
After an experiment with public groups to allow anonymous sharing of ideas around a goal we've decided to simplify the interface and integrate this to the share/get hints feature.

- **Header simplified by moving navigation to a footer menu**  
 The header that replaced the side-menu a year ago is simplified by moving the three most-used options for navigating screens to the bottom, where they are easily accessible for mobile users' thumbs. It is also being simplified to only show three making it clear what icons mean - and which one is selected:  
 Old header: 
<img src="/img/old_header.png" alt="old-header" width="400"/>  
New header: <img src="/img/new_header_2023-09.png" alt="new-header" width="400"/>  
New footer: <img src="/img/new_footer_2023-09.png" alt="new-footer" width="400"/>  

- **Moved goal actions to circle**  
The sub-menu that expanded when pressing a goal was quite crowded. We've split the buttons into frequently used actions (that can by accessed by pressing the goal circle), and the infrequently used 'edit'. The same number of clicks - but a cleaner interface. 
<img src="/img/goal_actions_moved.gif" alt="new-header" width="400"/>  

- **Auto update app** 
There is no longer a question in your inbox 'Do you want to update?'. App updates are applied automaticly so you don't have to think about it. They will mostly not require a restart ... but they sometimes might.

- **Better tagline**  
"Better together" is a tagline that:  
  - is simpler and shorter - and thus easier to remember
  - has a more ethical feel
  - fits more of the ZinZen use cases / target markets than "Realize dreams together"
  <img src="/img/better_together_tagline.png" alt="new-tagline" width="400"/> 

- **Goal sharing improvements** 
Fixed a few bugs and the overall goal-sharing flow.

- **Done indicator**
Added a percentage done indicator <img src="/img/done_indicator.png" alt="done-indicator" width="400"/>  

- **Switch language**
Accidentally chosen the wrong interface language - or just curious? You can now change your interface language through the 'three dot' menu: <img src="/img/change_language.gif" alt="change_language" width="400"/>  

- **Drag 'n Drop**
Not happy with the order of your goals? Just drag and drop!: <img src="/img/drag_and_drop.gif" alt="drag-and-drop" width="400
"/>  

- **Nicer breadcrumb menu**
Improved the looks of the breadcrumb menu: <img src="/img/breadcrumb_2023-09.gif" alt="breadcrumb" width="400
"/>  

- **Subtexts for feelings show**  
<img src="/img/subtexts_for_feeling_context.png" alt="feeling-subtexts" width="400

- **Show minutes as superscript**  
<img src="/img/minutes_superscript.png" alt="superscript" width="400
