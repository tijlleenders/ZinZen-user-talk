@Testers: 🙏**THANK YOU**🙏 !  
@All users: Please use [the feedback page](https://zinzen.me/Feedback).

Thanks [Tushar](https://github.com/Tushar-4781) for the many updates on the user interface - and for pulling an all-nighter 💪🏽 to save us just in time for a big corporate demo. Thanks also to [Mallika](https://github.com/mallikarai05) for her design work and [Mustafa](https://github.com/Mustafa-Eldeeb) for helping improve the Rust scheduler!

A big welcome to [Moaz](https://github.com/moaz-mokhtar) who will be testing the ZinZen® Rust waters in the coming week. 

## Visible updates 🎁🎁🎁

- **✨The automagic scheduler✨**  
**Manage your _agenda_ 🎯** - not your calendar 📆!  
You determine the guardrails for success:  
  - How many hours per week?
  - Which days and/or times?
  - What's the start and/or due date?  

  That's all the automagic calender needs to make your personalized schedule!

- **Collaboration**  
ZinZen® was designed from the ground up with collaboration in mind.  
Setting up a sharing relationship initially:

  Accepting a relationship invitation:

  Accepting to collaborate on a goal:

  Getting updates:

- **Public groups**  
Public groups allow anonymous sharing of ideas around a goal:

- **Readable header**  
We've listened to your feedback. A new header menu to replace the sidebar - completely in the new theme we implemented in November 2022, making it clear what icons mean - and which one is selected:  
<img src="/img/new_header.png" alt="new-header" width="400"/>  

- **Archive goals with a sound** 
A few people told us they particularly enjoy the 'complete' sound when ticking off tasks in other tools. We now have this too! ... You can turn it off in the menu.

- **Backup-restore**
If you put your life agenda in ZinZen® - you need assurance you can also take it out again. You can now switch devices or migrate to a different tool - for free.  Another excellent feature that is usually made hard in commercial tools - as there is no incentive to let you switch. In the European Union - regulation was even needed to push big tech to make this possible!  

  Export your goals to a file. This is a fully local operation - so nothing gets sent to ZinZen®.  
Import on the same or a different device. The restore will add all tasks, overriding the ones that already exist (same id) - but not deleting any other existing goals.

  - Translation fixes and back buttons where missing
  - Make browser lang first choice on startup
  - Example goals on startup for new user
