## Investor pitch

Last week I gave the following [60 second pitch](https://ZinZen.me/invest) to the following investors:  
- Jeroen van Doornik from [Pacenotes Venture Capital](http://pacenotes.vc/)  
- Liduina Hammer from [Innovation Quarter](https://www.innovationquarter.nl/en/)
- Martin Luxemburg from [Unknown Group](https://www.unknowngroup.com/)
- Reinier Meurs from [Graduate Entrepreneuer](http://graduate.nl/)
- Vadym Antsyferov as Angel Investor

The conclusion is that without traction - there is no interest.

Here's a picture of me pitching.
