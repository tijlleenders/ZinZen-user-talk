Most people didn't know what to do in the first versions of ZinZen.  
The menu's were just too complex.  

That is about to change in the coming weeks...  

## No more login wall (done)
You now don't have to log in to see ZinZen.me in action.  
By default you get my public profile, which gives you a taste of what is possible with your own account. Click around in the ZinZen roadmap, or check out what other stuff I like to do with my life. Maybe even contribute anonymously... 

Then when you're convinced it is worth trying - you can create an (anonymous) login for yourself.

## No more social login (done)
User experience has shown that the option to do the 'one-click' social login with Google/Facebook/Apple/Amazon is just not something interesting. Especially for a new app that you don't trust yet.  
So we removed it, en passant making the login interface a lot cleaner and clearer. You get a prominent main login user/pass... as well as a link to a subcribe/create account page just below it.

## Just the text box, please (in progress)
Configuring all the scheduling for a goal was just too complex. You had a menu for the start date, the finish date, the times of days of the week, the timezone, the duration, the min-max per day/week, the min/max size... Pfewww! Forget it man!  

Now, you just type what you want naturally. Not a single menu.  

Type "Walk 30m daily" and you will get two suggested buttons:
- Takes: 30 minutes
- Schedule: daily
  
Tap them if you want to 'enable' them - and your goal "Walk" is scheduled for 30 mins daily.  
Not on weekends? Just type 'not on weekends' or 'except weekends' and click to confirm.
